# Deal Templates

## Deal Templates Structure

Each deal template is a JSON text document with a name corresponding to a unique deal token 
(e.g. [colusa.JSON](https://badjupiter.github.io/v2-deals/colusa.json "Colusa Player Feedback")). 
Optionally there may be a corresponding image file with the same token identifier (in the case 
of Colusa Casino, [colusa.png](https://badjupiter.github.io/v2-deals/colusa.png).
